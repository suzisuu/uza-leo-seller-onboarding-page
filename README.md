🚀 UzaLeo - Modern Seller Onboarding Landing Page

Project Overview

UzaLeo is a high-conversion, responsive single-page marketing website designed for a seller onboarding platform. The goal was to create a professional, engaging, and fast user experience (UX) to guide potential sellers through the platform's benefits and process, culminating in a clear call-to-action (CTA).

This project was built using clean, vanilla front-end technologies to ensure maximum performance and accessibility.

✨ Key Features

Professional Design: Utilizes a modern, high-contrast color palette and the Inter font family for a clean, trustworthy aesthetic.

Fully Responsive Layout: Designed and optimized using CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries to ensure a perfect display on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Grid-Based Testimonials: Features a simple, clean, and responsive grid to display social proof and seller feedback, replacing the complex carousel for better stability and UX.

High-Value Interactivity (Vanilla JS):

Smooth Scrolling: Implements JavaScript for smooth, animated scrolling when navigating between sections.

Form Feedback: Provides instant visual confirmation on the Contact Form submit button, enhancing the user experience on the static page.
